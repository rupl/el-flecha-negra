# About _El Flecha Negra_

The essence of _El Flecha Negra_ and his deep wish of exploding into every corner of his creativity is the soul of this young musical group, a result of divergent backgrounds with a growing number of fans every day. They have a unique auditory and visual style which provokes reflection, creates suspense, brings relief, spreads joy, and feeds the spirit of protest while igniting the imagination of all who hear them.

A mix of cultures from Latin America spreading the legend of _El Flecha Negra_ crosses into the universal imaginary collective to share a glimpse of the heart beat that moves the world. These needles of culture weave a fantastic tapestry of stories, creating a character that is no stranger to reality and modern life. _El Flecha Negra_ reflects a wild outlook that paints a picture of today's society: love, passion, sadness, and celebration.

_El Flecha Negra_ is a roaring river made of many different musical currents. At its heart are latin rhythms like reggae and cumbia, and they flow seamlessly together with accoustic vibes to form a unique sound. Many years ago the members met in Barcelona, the cradle of half blood bands, where everyone plays in different groups: barrio candela, microguagua, green valley, mañaners, and many more.

Each one of the members has a deep history in the music scene, playing many stages of Europe and Latin America. After many years of sharing and playing separately, they decided to shape this cheerful and charismatic band. They first formed during June of 2014 in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.

In Freiburg that they are taking the first steps with this project on the streets of the city. It is just as it says in _El Flecha Negra_ — there is nothing more spontaneous and magic than the streets.

They perform in all kinds of rooms, bars, streets and festivals. They spread music, energy, and joy to all who cross their path. In 2015 they are creating their first studio production using their unique mix of accoustic and electric styles, featuring special guests from around the world.
