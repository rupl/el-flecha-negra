# About _El Flecha Negra_

_EL FLECHA NEGRA_ is a roaring river fed by diverse musical sources. Coming from Chile, Peru, Mexico, Spain, and Germany, the musicians combine traditional styles such as Cumbia and Swing Ranchera with reggae, surf and mestizo sounds, a wild mixture that is surprisingly harmonious and goes straight to your heart!

Years of stage experience and deep roots in the music scene of Latin America and Barcelona come together in this young and charismatic band. The musicians enjoy every breath of their creativity and transmit this joy to their listeners. Together they weave a fantastic tapestry of love, devotion and passion.

It all started in the summer of 2014 spontaneously at open air concerts and was met with an incredible response. "Nowhere is there more magic and spontaneity than on the street," the band members say. In 2015 they released their debut album _Schwarzwald_, a tribute to their hometown of Freiburg, nestled in the Black Forest. From there they took their multicultural show on the road, visiting Spain, the UK, Switzerland, and even to Chile, enchanting audiences around the world.

The new studio album _Tropikal Passport_ will be released in October 2017.
